# üè† Housing Prices Prediction ‚Äì Gurgaon

A machine learning project to predict housing prices in **Gurgaon** using **Scikit-learn pipelines** and regression algorithms.  
This project covers **data preprocessing, feature transformation, and model building** to create a robust price prediction system.

## üìå Project Overview
Real estate prices in **Gurgaon** vary widely depending on multiple factors such as location, area, furnishing, and transaction type.  
This project aims to:
- Analyze the factors influencing property prices.
- Build and evaluate regression models.
- Implement a clean **machine learning pipeline** for reproducibility.

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Gurgaon using machine learning techniques. The goal was to analyze historical housing data, identify the key factors that influence property prices, and develop a predictive model capable of estimating prices for new listings. The workflow included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building using regression algorithms. A robust pipeline was created using Scikit-learn tools such as StratifiedShuffleSplit, SimpleImputer, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler, and ColumnTransformer to handle both numerical and categorical variables efficiently. Models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor were trained and evaluated. The final results showed that the model‚Äôs predictions were consistently close to actual prices, making it a reliable tool for real estate price estimation in the Gurgaon market.
