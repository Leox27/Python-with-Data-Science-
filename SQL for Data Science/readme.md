## 📚 SQL Concepts Covered

### 🏗️ Database & Table Design -
- `CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE`
- Data types: `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL`, `BOOLEAN`, etc.
- Primary keys, foreign keys, and table relationships

### 📥 Data Manipulation (DML) -
- `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Bulk inserts with realistic HR-related data (employees, departments, reviews)

### 🔍 Querying with SELECT -
- Simple `SELECT` statements
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`
- Sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Aliases with `AS`

### 🧮 Aggregate Functions & Grouping -
- `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Combining conditions using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

### 🔗 Table Joins -
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`
- Joining multiple tables like `employees`, `departments`, `performance_reviews`, `projects`

### 📈 Advanced Queries -
- Subqueries (inline and nested)
- `CASE` statements for conditional logic
- Date calculations with `DATEDIFF`, `CURDATE`, `MONTH`, etc.

### 🔄 Views -
- Created an `hr_summary` view for dashboard-like data visualization
- Used for data abstraction and reusable reports

### ⚙️ Triggers -
- Wrote a trigger (`trg_salary_update`) that logs audit entries when an employee’s salary changes

### 🧰 Stored Procedures -
- Created a procedure `promote_employee` to automate employee promotions and salary logging

## 🎯 Real-World Query Examples 

Some of the business-oriented query examples in `queries.sql` include:

- Top 3 performers by department
- Department with the highest average salary
- Monthly hiring trends
- Employee tenure over 5 years
- Employees working on more than 2 projects

These simulate real HR or data analyst tasks.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

- ✅ Reinforces how **SQL is crucial** in data science pipelines (data cleaning, querying, analysis)
- ✅ Demonstrates **hands-on data modeling** — crucial for analytics
- ✅ Shows **production-ready SQL skills** like triggers, procedures, and views
- ✅ Excellent showcase for interviews and technical assessments

## 🧑‍🔬 What’s Next?

This SQL foundation will be integrated into the next steps of my Data Science path:

- Python + Pandas for data manipulation  
- SQL + Python integration using libraries like `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy`  
- Using SQL with Jupyter Notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizing data from SQL queries using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
